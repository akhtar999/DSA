function addItem(n) {
  return n + n;
}

// there is only one operation is here that is addition
// So, it doesn't matter whether n is 1 or million. opration gonna only 1.
// and that is O(1).

//what if we add another n + n + n. that is two operation that is constant O(1). no matter what n is, the opeartion doesn't change as in changes.

// this is the most efficient big O. (constant time).
